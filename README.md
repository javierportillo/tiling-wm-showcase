# tiling-wm-showcase
Python script that uses tkinter to spawn multiple windows with unique background color so you can showcase your tiling window manager behaviuor.

# Usage

Easiest way of running this app is to download the pre-built executable if you're on windows, go to the [releases](https://github.com/javierportillo/tiling-wm-showcase/releases)
and download the `.exe` file from a `cmd` or `powershell` terminal with `.\tiling_wm_showcase <num_windows>`.

If you don't trust the pre-built executable, you can install Python on your system (make sure to install Tkinter on windows) and just download
the `main.py` from this repo and run it with `python main.py <num_windows>`

Have fun!
